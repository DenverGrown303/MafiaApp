Response to RFP-AG from Omerta Group:</strong>

<p>This proposal was voluntarily prepared for the Omerta Group without any duress or coercion.  Of our of own free will, we are preparing this proposal pro-bono in coordination with a representative group of the the Italian-American community.  We are designing a new web application to act as community portal for La Cosa Nostra (which of course is an organization that does not, to our knowledge, in fact exist).</p>

<p>This proposal is in conjunction with a marketing, community outreach, and rebranding package for La Cosa Nostra (which of course is an organization that does not, to our knowledge, in fact exist).</p>
